> Personal Income Spending Flowchart - United States

## The Problem

The subreddit [/r/personalfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) has a graphical [flowchart](https://i.imgur.com/lSoUQr2.png) that I reference often but I always run into the two same issues:

1. Navigating the flowchart on a mobile device can be difficult.
2. Sharing the flowchart with friends, family, and even strangers can be difficult.

## This Solution

I‘ve published the flowchart at an easy to remember domain [howtohandlemoney.com](https://howtohandlemoney.com/) and I‘ve converted the graphical flowchart into a responsive HTML page.
